        %h2 Be Picky
        %p.text-small
          We’re picky and you should be too. We only work on projects that excite us. We refer over half of the projects we’re asked to consider. That means we will help you find someone who fits your project better than we do.

        %p.text-small
          To help you build your dream, we research and learn about your business and industry. We ask lots of questions. Not every client we work with knows the answers, but they all want to know. Sometimes the start of the project means we help you answer the questions before we decide to move forward.

        %p.text-small
          We like to get features in front of stackholders as quickly as possible. This gives us a fast feedback loop; enabling us to change directions quickly. If you’re looking for a developer who disappears for a few weeks and comes back with something you’re looking in the wrong spot.

          At the end of each feature, we’ll make sure that we’re ready to measure the success so we know we’re building the right stuff. Getting features in front of your clients fast is the best way for us all to stay on track.
